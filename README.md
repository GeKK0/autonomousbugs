==============

to watch visualization, requires pygame:
    sudo apt-get install python-pygame

to start up the ant world:
    ./RunWorld.py

visualization:
    ant = red, scaled some to show energy (brighter = more energy)
    food = green
    rock = grey
    egg = whtie

new food and ants are added randomly to keep a minimum amount in the world
