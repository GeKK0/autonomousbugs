have everything on a grid to make it easier

If we look at the eight pieces surrounding an ant with 'up' being 'forward'
...
.X.
...

then movement can be reduced to 'turn' and 'move forward'

each grid can have an object on it:  (ant,rock,egg,food)
as well as keeping track of 'scent':  r,g,b

rock cannot be moved through

scent will be displayed as 'dim' to make it easier to see relative
to objects on the grid

blue = rock
white = egg
red = ant
green = food

output:
turn right, turn left, move forward, breed, eat, s1, s2, g, b

input:
energy, (rock, egg, food, g, b) * 5


breed or eat refers to object in front of ant
attempting to breed with egg of itself?
- option : sterile? kills egg
- option : random? randomly make a gene and breeds with it
